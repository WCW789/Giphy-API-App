# GiphyAPI

This is a program where if you click on a button, you will see 10 images related to the button's label.  Users are able to create buttons themselves.  If you click on the image, the image will move.  Click on the image again, and it will stop animating 

Used the Giphy API to get all the images.  There are 4 files total: 2 CSS sheets (reset and customized), the JavaScript code and the HTML page
